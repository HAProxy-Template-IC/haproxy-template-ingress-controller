# Assert the chart renders a vector.yaml that vector can actually load.

# Nothing else covers this. The chart's validationTests match regexes against the
# rendered text, and the span harness slices out only the VRL — neither notices
# that the document as a whole stopped being YAML. The failure mode is quiet and
# expensive: one template line indented past the block scalar's base ends the
# scalar early, vector rejects the config and keeps its bootstrap one (stdout
# sink, no metrics exporter), so the readiness probe never passes and the
# DaemonSet rollout wedges — with every offline gate reporting green.
#
# Runs on any chart change. `make lint-chart` invokes it.
