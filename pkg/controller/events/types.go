// Package events contains all domain event type definitions for the HAPTIC controller.
//
// # Event Immutability Contract
//
// Events in this system are intended to be immutable after creation. They represent
// historical facts about what happened in the system and should not be modified after
// being published to the EventBus.
//
// To support this immutability contract:
//
//  1. All event types use pointer receivers for their Event interface methods.
//     This avoids copying large structs (200+ bytes) and follows Go best practices.
//
//  2. All event fields are exported to support JSON serialization and idiomatic Go access.
//     This follows industry standards (Kubernetes, NATS) rather than enforcing immutability
//     through unexported fields and getters.
//
//  3. Constructors perform defensive copying of slices and maps to prevent mutations
//     from affecting the published event. Publishers cannot modify events after creation.
//
//  4. Consumers MUST NOT modify event fields. This immutability contract is enforced through:
//     - A custom static analyzer (tools/linters/eventimmutability) that detects parameter mutations
//     - Code review for cases not caught by the analyzer
//     - Team discipline and documentation
//
// This approach balances performance, Go idioms, and practical immutability for an
// internal project where all consumers are controlled.
//
// # Event Categories
//
// Events are organized into separate files by category:
//
//   - config.go:              HAProxyTemplateConfig CRD changes and validation events
//   - resource.go:            Kubernetes resource indexing and synchronization events
//   - reconciliation.go:      Template rendering and deployment cycle events
//   - template.go:            Template rendering operation events
//   - validation.go:          Configuration validation (syntax and semantics) events
//   - deployment.go:          HAProxy configuration deployment events
//   - discovery.go:           HAProxy pod discovery events
//   - credentials.go:         Credentials loading and validation events
//   - leader.go:              Leader election events
//   - publishing.go:          Config publishing events (including SyncMetadata types)
//   - certificate.go:         Webhook certificate events
//   - http.go:                HTTP resource events
//   - proposal.go:            Speculative validation requests/responses (used by webhook and HTTP store)
//   - status.go:              Status patch application events
