// handleStatusTrigger is the throttle-decision point for pod status
// updates (the parallel of processPublishWork's throttle, but for
// status-subresource writes instead of CRD spec writes). Three
// branches; only the immediate-process happy path was indirectly
// covered by integration tests, leaving the throttle-window
// decision unverified:
//
//  1. publishInterval <= 0 → process immediately. This is the
//     no-throttle configuration (default for tests/dev). A regression
//     that always entered the refractory branch would defer status
//     updates indefinitely (no timer would ever start because the
//     refractory window is always "in").
//
//  2. publishInterval > 0 + outside refractory window → process
//     immediately (leading-edge throttle). The first status update
//     after idle MUST fire without delay; without this branch the
//     status pipeline would always wait one full refractory period
//     before publishing.
//
//  3. publishInterval > 0 + inside refractory window → defer to
//     timer. This is the load-bearing throttle behavior: pending
//     status updates accumulate in statusWorkPending (already
//     coalesced per pod) until the timer fires. A regression that
//     processed immediately while inside the refractory would
//     defeat the throttle and let status updates hammer the K8s
//     status subresource at reconciliation rate.

// statusTriggerComponent constructs a Component populated only
// with the fields handleStatusTrigger touches. publisher is nil —
// the tested branches reach processAllPendingStatusWork at most,
// which has its own empty-map fast path that exits before the
// publisher is needed.
// statusTriggerComponent constructs a Component plus a throttle whose gate
// state matches the desired branch. Callers pass either:
//   - interval=0 (throttle disabled — gate always open)
//   - markFired=false (fresh throttle — gate open, "outside refractory")
//   - markFired=true  (throttle fired just now — gate closed, "inside refractory")
