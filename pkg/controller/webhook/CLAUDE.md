# pkg/controller/webhook

This package connects the pure HTTPS server in `pkg/webhook` to the synchronous
`DryRunValidator` and the controller's webhook metrics.

## Responsibilities

- Resolve configured GroupVersionResources to GroupVersionKinds.
- Build one complete validator table for the watched-resource rules.
- Run structural checks and `DryRunValidator.ValidateDirect` synchronously.
- Apply the controller-side admission deadline and record decisions.

Certificate provisioning and `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resources belong
to the Helm chart. Render and HAProxy validation belong to
`pkg/controller/dryrunvalidator` and `pkg/controller/proposalvalidator`.

## Lifecycle

Production passes a process-owned `*pkg/webhook.Server` in `Config.Server`. The
component installs its complete table with `ReplaceValidatorGeneration`; it
never starts or stops the shared listener. On iteration teardown it installs an
empty fail-closed generation. Replacement waits for requests using the retired
generation, then calls `OnGenerationRetired` to release captured iteration
dependencies.

If `Config.Server` is nil, the component owns the server. This mode is useful for
tests and standalone composition. `Start` binds the listener, serves until
cancellation or failure, shuts it down, and joins the serve loop.

The persistent listener reads the mounted `tls.crt` and `tls.key` through
`CertDir` and reloads changed certificate content during TLS handshakes.

## Admission contract

The chart creates rules only for watched resources with
`enableValidationWebhook: true`. Every rule uses `failurePolicy: Fail` and a
10-second API-server timeout. There is no `HAProxyTemplateConfig` admission
webhook; set-level config validation follows ADR-0016.

Registration is atomic. A rule without a dry-run validator fails component
startup. A request without a registered validator is denied with status 503,
and a validation canceled by iteration teardown is denied as unavailable.

Each registered validator:

1. Checks basic object structure.
2. Derives a 9-second deadline from the iteration context.
3. Calls `DryRunValidator.ValidateDirect` with the proposed object.
4. Returns its allow, reason, and warning result and records metrics.

Keep validation synchronous. The API server waits for the AdmissionReview
response, so detached work would return before the gate has made a decision.

## Tests

- `component_test.go` covers rule resolution, validation decisions, deadlines,
  and metrics.
- `component_adopted_test.go` covers atomic generation replacement, fail-closed
  teardown, and request draining on the shared listener.
- `pkg/webhook/server_test.go` covers TLS and AdmissionReview handling.

See `pkg/controller/webhook/README.md`, `pkg/webhook/CLAUDE.md`, and
`docs/adr/0016-one-config-kind-many-instances-pre-rollout-validation.md`.
