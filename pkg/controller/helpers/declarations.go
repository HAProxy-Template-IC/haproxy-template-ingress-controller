// BuildAdditionalDeclarations returns the additionalDeclarations
// map that every template engine constructed by this controller
// needs at compile time. Single source of truth — folds together
// the static `currentConfig` slot (needed by BackendServers and
// other slot-preservation logic) with one typed-resource global
// per watched-resource entry derived from typebootstrap.
//
// `result` MUST be non-nil and reflect a successful bootstrap
// against the cluster (or the embedded builtin set, for offline
// validate). Callers that don't have a real Result yet — e.g.
// the Stage-1 template validator — must obtain one via the
// injected TypeBootstrapper before calling this helper rather
// than passing nil. The previous envelope-only fallback path was
// removed because it false-positively rejected charts that used
// typed Spec/Status access (envelope only carries Metadata) and
// silently bound them to a mismatched shape elsewhere.
//
// # Adding a new engine consumer
//
// Call this function with the Result your caller obtained from
// typebootstrap.Bootstrap (or runTypeBootstrap in production),
// then pass the returned map straight into
// `templating.Options.Declarations` (or
// `helpers.NewEngineFromConfigWithOptions`'s
// `additionalDeclarations` parameter). Don't hand-merge — every
// site that did that previously had to be updated independently
// when the contract grew (Phase 4 added currentConfig; Phase
// 10–11 added typed globals); the helper bundles both.
