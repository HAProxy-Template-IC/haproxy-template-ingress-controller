# Documentation checks

Run the Python packaging and search checks from the repository root:

```bash
make test-agent-skill-package
```

The search check builds a Material site with generated ADRs and verifies that
Development pages remain readable without appearing in the user search index.

Run the embedded-playground browser regressions:

```bash
npm ci --prefix scripts/visual-qa
cd scripts/visual-qa
npx playwright install chromium
cd ../..
node --test docs/site/tests/playground-embed.mjs
```

The browser suite uses the shared embed script and styles with a local frame
fixture and the real playground shell. It checks viewport layout, keyboard navigation, edit preservation,
solution comparison, input switching, load failures, and cleanup during page navigation. It
doesn't test template rendering; use a built playground bundle to check that.
