# Share WAF policies across applications

Define a web application firewall (WAF) policy once, then let application teams
select it with an Ingress annotation. HAPTIC uses [Coraza](https://coraza.io/)
to inspect requests against the policy and the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)
Core Rule Set (CRS).

If your administrator has already configured a policy catalog, add its
case-sensitive policy name to your Ingress:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy-haptic.org/waf-policy: public-web
```

The following sections cover catalog setup, policy tuning, and permissions.
For individual route settings, see the [WAF annotations](../libraries/haptic-annotations.md#authentication-mtls-and-waf).

## Configure a trusted catalog

Add this reference to your [complete Helm values file](../deploying-with-helm.md#change-settings).
Create the referenced ConfigMap before applying the values:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    templatingSettings:
      extraContext:
        waf:
          policies:
            configMapRefs:
              security:
                namespace: security
                name: haptic-waf-policies
                key: policies.yaml
```

Create the `security` namespace if it doesn't exist:

```bash
kubectl create namespace security --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Save the following as `haptic-waf-policies.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: security
  name: haptic-waf-policies
data:
  policies.yaml: |
    public-web:
      requestBody:
        mode: none
      enforcement: deny
    json-api:
      requestBody:
        mode: json
        maxBytes: 4096
      enforcement: deny
```

Apply the ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl apply -f haptic-waf-policies.yaml
```

Then [apply your Helm values](../deploying-with-helm.md#change-settings).

Configuring a catalog activates Coraza and the Ingress permission checks. By
default, Ingress authors can select a policy but can't disable inspection,
change enforcement, or inject custom WAF or HAProxy rules. Protect the ConfigMap
with Kubernetes RBAC: anyone who can edit it can change the approved policies.
To keep the trusted catalog in your Helm values, use `policies.inline` instead
of a ConfigMap.

The default dispatch mode, `opt-in`, inspects annotated routes. Set
`waf.dispatch.mode: default-on` to inspect every route; its
`defaultEnforcement` applies where no policy or permitted override sets a mode.
See the [WAF settings reference](../reference.md#coraza-waf)
for all defaults and limits.

## Tune a policy

Start with the smallest change that resolves a false positive:

| Field | Use it to |
|-------|-----------|
| `description` | Explain which applications should select the policy. |
| `enforcement` | Block matches with `deny`, or record them with `detect`. |
| `requestBody` | Choose whether to inspect bodies and set their size limit; see below. |
| `allowedMethods`, `paranoiaLevel`, `anomalyThreshold` | Adjust allowed methods and CRS sensitivity. |
| `crsSettings` | Extend allowed content types or set `maxFileSize`, `maxNumArgs`, and `totalArgLength`. |
| `ruleExclusions` | Exclude a rule ID, optionally on a path, or exclude a variable from a rule ID or CRS tag. |
| `secLang` | Add custom Coraza directives where structured settings aren't enough. |

For example, a Git server can permit its upload media types while retaining CRS
content-type checks for other requests:

```yaml
crsSettings:
  allowedRequestContentTypes:
    - application/x-git-upload-pack-request
    - application/x-git-receive-pack-request
```

Use `ruleExclusions` when changing CRS inputs isn't enough. Path selectors are
`onPathPrefix`, `onPathSuffix`, `onPathExact`, and `onPathContains`. This exclusion
allows SQL-like search text in `q` while keeping the tagged checks on other inputs:

```yaml
ruleExclusions:
  - tags: [attack-sqli]
    excludeTarget: "ARGS:q"
```

Policy authors can't override HAPTIC's body-safety rules. Per-Ingress
[nginx-compatible custom rules](../libraries/nginx-ingress.md) are subject to
`waf.customRules.limits`, including when no catalog is configured.

## Choose request-body inspection

| `requestBody.mode` | Behavior |
|--------------------|----------|
| `none` | Inspect request metadata without buffering or limiting uploads. Use for gRPC streaming. |
| `any` | Inspect a complete body within the configured size limit. |
| `json` | Apply the same size limit and require a JSON media type. |

Enforced body inspection requires an unambiguous `Content-Length` and rejects
oversized or incomplete bodies before Coraza. It never inspects only a prefix
and passes an unchecked remainder.

A policy's `requestBody.maxBytes` defaults to
`waf.policies.requestBody.defaultMaxBytes` and can't exceed
`waf.policies.requestBody.maxBytes`. The separate ceiling lets you approve a
larger policy without enlarging every policy that uses the default. Both HAProxy
and Coraza enforce the effective limit. It must fit within the shared
[HAProxy request buffer](../reference.md#request-body-inspection-and-json-schema-validation).

### WAF and gRPC streaming

Use `requestBody.mode: none` for gRPC. Method, path, header, and source-IP checks
still run. Coraza's [body processors](https://coraza.io/docs/reference/body-processing/)
don't decode protobuf or gRPC messages.

Body inspection waits for the complete request, preventing the backend from
processing a stream as messages arrive. An enforced client-streaming or
bidirectional call that exceeds `waf.policies.requestBody.waitTimeout` receives
`408`. Unary calls still face buffering, size limits, and content-type checks.
Detect mode skips body-contract rejections and waits only when `Content-Length`
is present; an unbounded body remains uninspected.

Admission rejects body-inspecting policies on routes declared as `grpc`/`grpcs`
or nginx-compatible `GRPC`/`GRPCS`, including detect policies. An existing
combination emits `WafBodyPolicyOnGRPCRoute` and retains its runtime rules,
including body rejections. Change the policy to `mode: none`. Plain `h2`/`h2-ssl`
doesn't trigger this check because HTTP/2 also carries non-gRPC applications.

Use authentication, source-IP restrictions, and rate limits for gRPC access
control. `allowed-methods` filters HTTP methods, not gRPC method paths;
`max-request-body-size` limits an HTTP body, not individual gRPC messages.
Configure message-size limits in the gRPC application.

## Require a policy on every Ingress

To require a fixed baseline, configure a trusted default policy and prevent
Ingress authors from selecting alternatives:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    templatingSettings:
      extraContext:
        waf:
          ingressPermissions:
            allowPolicySelection: false
            allowEnforcementOverride: false
            allowWafDisable: false
            allowCustomRules: false
            allowRawHAProxyConfig: false
          policies:
            defaultPolicy: public-web
```

Define `public-web` in your trusted catalog before applying these values.
Removing WAF annotations then leaves the default policy in force. HAPTIC rejects
native and vendor annotations that bypass these permissions. Raw HAProxy
configuration is checked across all Ingresses because one frontend or global
snippet can affect other routes.

Grant `allowCustomRules` only to trusted policy authors: SecLang can disable or
rewrite rules. `allowRawHAProxyConfig` grants configuration-administrator
capabilities. Enforcement overrides and complete WAF opt-outs have separate
permissions; granting one doesn't grant the other.

## Self-service namespaced policies

Enable namespace-local policy catalogs when application teams should maintain
their own policies:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    templatingSettings:
      extraContext:
        waf:
          policies:
            selfService:
              enabled: true
```

Each team creates a `waf-policies` ConfigMap in its namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: team-a
  name: waf-policies
data:
  policies.yaml: |
    app-baseline:
      requestBody:
        mode: none
      enforcement: deny
```

An Ingress in `team-a` selects it with
`haproxy-haptic.org/waf-policy: app-baseline`. HAPTIC watches ConfigMaps with this
name and enables Coraza and policy permissions automatically.

| Boundary | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Namespace | A team can select its own policies and trusted policies. Cross-namespace names such as `team-a/app-baseline` are rejected. |
| Name conflicts | A local name that duplicates a trusted policy blocks that namespace's selection; it never silently replaces the trusted policy. |
| Cluster baseline | `defaultPolicy` resolves only from trusted catalogs. With `default-on`/`deny`, a self-service policy can't weaken enforcement to `detect`. |
| Body size and catalog growth | Administrator limits cap body sizes, policies per namespace, and total policies. |
| Custom rules | `selfService.allowSecLang` defaults to `false`. Count and size limits don't bound rule CPU cost. |

## Diagnose a rejected policy

Admission rejects invalid definitions and selections. If an invalid selection
already exists, HAPTIC returns `503` for affected routes and emits a Warning
Event. For an invalid self-service catalog, only selecting routes in that
namespace are affected; other namespaces continue rendering.

Inspect the Ingress and catalog ConfigMap Events. `WafPolicyCatalogInvalid`
identifies malformed catalog YAML; `WafPolicyInvalid` identifies a broken policy.
Fix the named definition or select an existing policy. Plugin outages have a
separate [failure policy](../reference.md#coraza-waf).
