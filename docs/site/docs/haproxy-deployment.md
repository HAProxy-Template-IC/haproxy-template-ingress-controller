# Configure HAProxy pods and access

<a id="overview"></a>

The chart deploys two HAProxy replicas by default. Configure [Service access](#haproxy-service),
[replicas and autoscaling](#replicas-and-autoscaling), and [resource budgets](#resource-limits)
through Helm values. Use `haproxy.podSpec` for scheduling, volumes, and other pod
settings. Add settings to your [complete Helm values file](deploying-with-helm.md#change-settings).
You can also [manage the pods separately](#haproxy-pod-requirements).

## Resource limits

Use the [resource sizing guide](operations/performance.md#controller-resource-sizing) to budget the installation. Set HAProxy resources with `haproxy.resources` and agent resources with `haproxy.agent.resources`.

## Expose traffic and management ports

Separate Services expose controller health and metrics, the admission webhook, HAProxy traffic and stats, and the HAPTIC agent.

### Controller Service

The controller's `ClusterIP` Service exposes health and metrics ports. For a
release named `haptic`, the Service is also named `haptic`. Other release names
use the chart's `fullname`, usually `<release>-haptic`:

| Name | Container port | Values key | Purpose |
|------|----------------|------------|---------|
| `healthz` | 8080 | `controller.ports.healthz` | Single source for the process listener, liveness/readiness probes, Service, and `/debug/*` introspection endpoints |
| `metrics` | 9090 | `controller.ports.metrics` | Single source for the process listener, Service, and Prometheus monitors; `0` disables metrics |

The separate `<fullname>-webhook` Service exposes port `443` (`controller.webhook.service.port`) and forwards to port `9443` (`controller.ports.webhook`).

Configure the health and metrics Service under `controller.service`:

```yaml
controller:
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    annotations: {}
```

### HAProxy Service

The `<fullname>-haproxy` Service sends traffic to HAProxy pods. For a release
named `haptic`, it's `haptic-haproxy`. It uses `NodePort` by default; configure
its ports through `haproxy.service.*` and pod ports through `haproxy.ports.*`:

| Name | Service port | Container port | nodePort default |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| `http` | 80 | 80 | 30080 |
| `https` | 443 | 443 | 30443 |
| `stats` | 8404 | 8404 | 30404 |

The agent gets its own internal-only `ClusterIP` Service (`<fullname>-haproxy-dataplane`, for example `<release>-haptic-haproxy-dataplane`) on port 5555. Its type comes from `haproxy.agent.service.type`.

**Local access**, including kind clusters, works with `kubectl port-forward`
regardless of Service type. For a release named `haptic` in namespace `haptic`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n haptic service/haptic-haproxy 8080:80
```

In another terminal, send requests to `http://localhost:8080` with the hostname
configured on your Ingress. HTTP and HTTPS Gateways use
[their own Services](gateway-api.md#step-4-test-the-routing); port-forward to
the Gateway's Service to reach its listeners. NodePort access from the host also
requires a reachable node address or matching kind port mappings.

**LoadBalancer access** requires a load-balancer implementation in your cluster.
Set the Service type and any annotations required by that implementation:

```yaml
haproxy:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

**External / self-managed HAProxy** — turn off the chart's HAProxy deployment and manage pods yourself (see [HAProxy Pod Requirements](#haproxy-pod-requirements)):

```yaml
haproxy:
  enabled: false
```

### PROXY protocol

If an upstream load balancer replaces the client address, HAProxy sees that
balancer as the source. Access logs, source-IP rate limits, and IP-based policies
then use the address of the balancer.

The load balancer fixes this by adding a PROXY protocol header that carries the
original address. Enable the matching listeners:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    templatingSettings:
      extraContext:
        proxyProtocol:
          enabled: true
          httpPort: 8081
          httpsPort: 8444
```

That adds two binds, adds them to the HAProxy Service and the NetworkPolicy, and
leaves `haproxy.ports.http` / `haproxy.ports.https` exactly as they were. Point
the balancer at the new ports:

```haproxy
# On the upstream load balancer
server k8s-https 10.0.0.50:8444 send-proxy-v2
```

Requests arriving on the PROXY ports carry the real client through the access
log's `client_ip`, `src`-keyed rate limiting, the WAF, and IP access control
lists. Terminated HTTPS on `httpsPort` uses the same certificates, ciphers, and
protocol negotiation as the plain HTTPS bind; with TLS-Passthrough configured,
`httpsPort` attaches to the SNI-routing frontend instead so passthrough hosts
keep working.

!!! warning "Send the header, or the connection is dropped"
    HAProxy has no "PROXY header optional" mode. A connection reaching
    `httpPort` or `httpsPort` without the header is rejected, so only the
    upstream balancer may target these ports. Everything else — direct access,
    in-cluster clients, NodePort traffic, probes — keeps using the regular
    `haproxy.ports.http` / `haproxy.ports.https`, which is why these are
    additional ports rather than a flag on the existing ones.

This is separate from the
[`haproxy-haptic.org/proxy-protocol`](libraries/haptic-annotations.md)
annotation, which makes HAProxy *send* a PROXY header to a backend.

    https: 443       # HAProxy container HTTPS bind
    stats: 8404      # Stats/health page
    dataplane: 5555  # HAPTIC agent
  service:
    type: NodePort   # ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer
    annotations: {}
    loadBalancerIP: ""
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: []
    externalTrafficPolicy: ""   # Cluster | Local
    http:
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30080           # Only honored for NodePort/LoadBalancer
    https:
      port: 443
      nodePort: 30443
    stats:
      port: 8404
      nodePort: 30404
```

## Replicas and autoscaling

The chart runs 2 HAProxy replicas by default. Set `haproxy.replicaCount` to change the fixed count:

```yaml
haproxy:
  replicaCount: 3
```

For traffic-driven autoscaling, enable [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) under `haproxy.keda`. When `haproxy.keda.enabled` is true, the chart creates a `ScaledObject` and stops writing a fixed `replicas` onto the Deployment (KEDA owns it), scaling between `minReplicaCount` and `maxReplicaCount` from the triggers you define:

```yaml
haproxy:
  keda:
    enabled: true
    minReplicaCount: 2
    maxReplicaCount: 10
    triggers:
      - type: cpu
        metricType: Utilization
        metadata:
          value: "70"
```

KEDA must be installed in the cluster, and `haproxy.keda.triggers` must list at least one trigger — it's empty by default. Any [KEDA scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/) works; the block above uses CPU utilization.

## Initial bootstrap config

New HAProxy pods start with a minimal configuration from `haproxy.initialConfig`,
stored in the `<fullname>-haproxy-config` ConfigMap. For the default release name,
that's `haptic-haproxy-config`. The controller replaces it with your rendered
configuration.

The default keeps `/healthz` returning 200 on the stats port and `/ready` returning 503 ("waiting for controller config"), so the pod stays NotReady until the controller applies its first real config.

Once the agent receives and successfully loads the rendered configuration,
`/ready` returns `200` and Kubernetes adds the pod to the Service. If that first
apply fails, the agent restores the bootstrap files and the pod stays unready.

On a later container restart, HAProxy reuses the configuration on disk if it
passes `haproxy -c`. It falls back to the bootstrap configuration only if the
file is missing or invalid.

If you replace `haproxy.initialConfig`, preserve the worker socket, `/healthz`,
and a `/ready` response of `503`. Returning `200` would send application traffic
to a pod before its routes exist. The value supports Helm template expressions;
changing it rolls the HAProxy pods on the next upgrade.

Read, customize, and forward request logs with the [access logging guide](operations/access-logging.md).
It also covers request IDs, the Vector sidecar, and monitoring dropped records.

## Pod readiness and restarts

Each pod runs HAProxy in master-worker mode plus the HAPTIC agent, which owns
the pod's file tree and its runtime sockets. The chart supervises the SPOA hub
and Vector processes inside their sidecar containers: a child exit or repeated
failed health check leaves HAProxy running while the supervisor restarts only
that child, with a backoff capped at 30 seconds.

HAProxy's `/ready` endpoint controls pod readiness. It returns `503` while the
bootstrap configuration is active and `200` once a rendered configuration runs.
The agent, SPOA hub, and Vector run as native sidecars: Kubernetes starts them
before HAProxy and stops them after HAProxy exits, preserving dependencies during
connection draining.

The agent's `/readyz` endpoint reports whether it can accept configuration updates;
a rejected update doesn't make it unready. Its liveness probe uses the local Unix
socket. A stopped container or a failing probe on a custom sidecar can still make
the pod unready.

The watchdog uses `/usr/bin/bash` and `timeout`, which the default images provide.
With a custom sidecar image missing either command, the supervisor logs a warning
and still restarts child processes that exit.

## HAProxy Pod requirements

When `haproxy.enabled: false`, you're responsible for deploying HAProxy pods yourself. The controller discovers them via the pod selector at `controller.config.podSelector`, which defaults to:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: loadbalancer
        app.kubernetes.io/name: haptic        # set dynamically by the chart
        app.kubernetes.io/instance: haptic  # your Helm release name
```

If your existing HAProxy pods don't have those exact labels, either relabel them or override `controller.config.podSelector.matchLabels` to match.

Each discovered pod must:

1. **Carry labels matching `podSelector.matchLabels`**
2. **Run HAProxy in master-worker mode** with a master socket the agent can reload through, and a worker `stats socket` it can run runtime commands on
3. **Run the agent** in the same pod, from the HAPTIC image, sharing the config volume with HAProxy
4. **Expose the agent** on `haproxy.ports.dataplane` (default 5555), mounting its TLS identity and trusting the controller identity; see [agent certificates](operations/agent-certificates.md)
5. **Run the same HAProxy major.minor series as `haproxyVersion`** so the controller validates configuration with the matching binary
6. **Keep the agent available during termination** with native-sidecar ordering and the drain hook used by the chart
7. **Provide every dependency selected by your templates**, including SPOA plugins and log sockets when enabled

### Start from the deployment for your installed version

A separate workload controller must preserve the agent's TLS mounts, shared
volumes, runtime sockets, bootstrap configuration, probes, and termination
ordering. Use the chart-generated deployment for your version as the reference;
a minimal HAProxy-plus-agent manifest omits dependencies enabled by default.

For an existing `haptic` release in namespace `haptic`, export its deployment
for inspection:

```bash
kubectl get deployment haptic-haproxy -n haptic -o yaml > haptic-haproxy-reference.yaml
helm get manifest haptic -n haptic > haptic-release-reference.yaml
```

The second file includes the associated bootstrap ConfigMaps and Services.
Identity Secrets are managed separately, as described in
[agent certificate management](operations/agent-certificates.md).
Set `haproxy.enabled: false` only once your external workload definition supplies
these dependencies and matches the configured pod selector. Helm removes its
Deployment when you disable it; plan that ownership change as a rollout.
